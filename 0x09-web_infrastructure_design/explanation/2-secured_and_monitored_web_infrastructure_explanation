### For every additional element, why you are adding it?

* Added a firewall after DNS to prevent any unwanted traffic from the internet.
* Include SSL certificate to encrypt data.
* Added Sumo Logic monitoring software to monitor the health of the LB and addionally added 2 more at both servers aswell.
* Added two extra firewalls before the server as an extra layer of protection.

### What are firewalls for?

* Firewalls act as security guards at a night club. They prevent any unauthorized access, malicious attacks and unwanted traffic to your systems

### Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?

* The 'S' in HTTPS is for secure which encrypts the data while in transport preventing eavesdropping, tampering, or interception from attackers.

### What monitoring is used for?

* To monitor the health of the system by checking the storage capacity, networks and the behavior of the system and displays it as a log file to the developer.

### How the monitoring tool is collecting data?

* It can collects data locally via Agent software installed on individual servers.
* It can do it remotely via SSH to collect data from the servers.
* By using API from Third Party Systems, applications or cloud services.

### Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?

* By doing that it will increase the risk of exposure of the data in transit. The data will not be encrypted.

### Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?

* If the server fails then it is prone to risks of limitations, scaleability constraints and data redundancy

### Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem?

* It is not setup for backup purposes or failover mechanism in case SPOF occures.
